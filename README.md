# Simon-Project

## Overview

For Project 1, I made a clone of the classic Simon Game.

Upon landing on the page, the player sees a button to start the game. Once pressed, the computer automatically starts their turn. The sequence will start at 1 and progress gradually as the player repeats the sequence.
Upon reaching a sequence of ten, the game is finished and the player wins.
